BitKeeper License version 1.38, 03/28/02

1.  DEFINITIONS

BKL:  This license in its entirety, also known as the BitKeeper
  License.

You:  The licensee of the BitKeeper Software.

BitMover:  The licensor of the BitKeeper Software.

BitKeeper Software:  The complete set of executable programs and
  any accompanying files, such as documentation, known as the BitKeeper
  Software.  The set of programs and files must include all files and
  programs distributed by BitMover as part of the BitKeeper Software.

BitKeeper Package:  A set of files managed by the same BitKeeper
  ChangeSet file.  There may be multiple instances of the package;
  each instance is called a repository.

Single user BitKeeper Package:  A BitKeeper Package wherein
  all changes to all files are made by the same person and the total
  number of files does not exceed 1000.

Metadata:  Information about the data managed by the BitKeeper Software
  in a BitKeeper Package, such as

  + The ChangeSet file;

  + The messages which annotate modifications of the data (also known
  as check in comments, ChangeLog entries, and/or log messages);

  + All files contained in the top level BitKeeper directory in a
    BitKeeper Package, in particular the BitKeeper/html directory
    and the  BitKeeper/etc/config file.

Open Logging:  The transmission of Metadata about the data
  managed by the BitKeeper Software, to a functioning Open Logging
  server in the openlogging.org domain (or an alternative domain as
  posted on www.bitkeeper.com/logging).  Examples of such collected
  information may be seen at http://www.openlogging.org.

Conforming Software:  BitKeeper Software that:

(i)   passes all of the current, unmodified, regression
      tests for the BitKeeper Software;

(ii)  performs all licensing functions, such as Open Logging,
      identically to the current version of the BitKeeper Software
      as distributed by BitMover, Inc.

2.  LICENSE GRANTS

Licensees may freely install, use, copy, and distribute Conforming
Software.

3.  LICENSEE OBLIGATIONS

(a) Maintaining Open Logging Feature:  You hereby warrant
    that you will not take any action to disable or otherwise
    interfere with the Open Logging feature of the BitKeeper Software.
    You hereby warrant that you will take any necessary actions to
    ensure that the BitKeeper Software successfully transmits the
    Metadata to an Open Logging server within 7 days of the creation
    of said Metadata.  By transmitting the Metadata to an Open Logging
    server, You hereby grant BitMover, or any other operator of an
    Open Logging server, permission to republish the Metadata sent
    by the BitKeeper Software to the Open Logging server.

(b) Modifications:  You may provide, at your option, modifications
    to BitMover.  By doing so, You grant BitMover permission to
    distribute the modification under any license.  This provision
    survives any termination of your license.  In return, BitMover
    promises that future versions of the BitKeeper Software that
    contain your modification will be available under the BKL.

(c) Accessing Others' BitKeeper Package:  You may only use
    the BitKeeper Software to access a BitKeeper Package created by
    BitMover or third parties if you comply with the license of the
    BitKeeper Package, which can be  found at the BitKeeper/etc/REPO
    LICENSE file within the BitKeeper Package and/or by  running bk
    repo license.

(d) Notwithstanding any other terms in this License, this
    License is not available to You if You and/or your employer
    develop, produce, sell, and/or resell a product which contains
    substantially similar capabilities of the BitKeeper Software,
    or, in the reasonable opinion of BitMover, competes with the
    BitKeeper Software.

(e) Inclusion with another product having source and/or
    configuration management features:  Inclusion of the BitKeeper
    Software for use with a system having substantially similar
    capabilities of the BitKeeper Software requires prior written
    permission from BitMover.

4.  NON-CONFORMING USE

4.1.  Single user packages

For single user BitKeeper Packages, Open Logging is optional.

4.2.  Closed Use

Closed use is the use of the BitKeeper Software without participating
in BKL licensing restrictions such as Open Logging.  Closed use
of the BitKeeper Software requires that you (or your organization)
purchase closed use licenses for all users of the BitKeeper Software
within your organization.  This license, the BKL, does not convey
authority to make closed use of the BitKeeper Software.

4.3.  Logging Waivers

Certain sites which do not wish to participate in Open Logging, such as
educational or research institutes, may apply for, and may be granted,
a written waiver from Bit- Mover, Inc.  After applying for a written
waiver, such an institution may use the BitKeeper Software without
Open Logging, for up to 90 days, or until a response is received from
BitMover, Inc., whichever comes first.  Should BitMover not grant your
waiver request, you have the option of converting to Open Logging,
immediately ter- minating your use of the BitKeeper Software or
continuing your use after purchasing closed use license[s].

4.4.  Damages

Use, copying, or distribution of non-conforming software is a
violation of copyrights held by BitMover on the Bit- Keeper Software.
Damages for copyright infringement are the greater of actual damages or
statutory damages, which are currently up to $150,000 per infringement.

This license is not available to You if You and/or your company have
any unresolved copyright disputes with Bit- Mover.

BitMover reserves the right to terminate this license for any licensee
or group of licensees whose usage under the terms of the BKL results
in support costs to BitMover in excess of $20,000.
