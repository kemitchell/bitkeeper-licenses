Metadata:  Information about the data managed by the BitKeeper Software in a BitKeeper Package, such as

  + The ChangeSet file;

  + The messages which annotate modifications of the data (also known as check in comments, ChangeLog entries, and/or log messages);

  + All infrastructure files contained below the top level BitKeeper directory in a BitKeeper Package.  User data files, i.e., files contained in the BitKeeper/deleted directories are explicitly excluded.

Open Logging:  The transmission of Metadata about the data managed by the BitKeeper Software, to a functioning Open Logging server in the openlogging.org domain (or an alternative  domain as posted on www.bitkeeper.com/logging).

2.  LICENSE GRANTS

Licensees may install and use the BitKeeper Software for its intended purpose.

3.  LICENSEE OBLIGATIONS

(a) Maintaining Open Logging Feature:  You hereby warrant that You will not take any action to disable or otherwise interfere with the Open Logging feature of the BitKeeper Software.  You hereby warrant that You will take any necessary actions to ensure that the BitKeeper Software successfully transmits the Metadata to an Open Logging server within 21 days of the creation of said Metadata. By transmitting the Metadata to an Open Logging server, You hereby grant BitMover, or any other operator of an Open Logging server, permission to republish the Metadata sent by the BitKeeper Software to the Open Logging server.

(b) Accessing Others' BitKeeper Package:  You may only use the BitKeeper Software to access a BitKeeper Package created by BitMover or third parties if You comply with the license of the BitKeeper Package, which can be found at the BitKeeper/etc/REPO_LICENSE file within the BitKeeper Package and/or by running bk repo_license.

(c) Maintaining Open Source:  It is the intent of BitMover that Your use of BitKeeper under this license is for the purpose of maintaining Open Source. By accepting this license, You agree that You are prepared to demonstrate Your conformance, at the request of BitMover, by making your BitKeeper repositories publicly available via the BitKeeper protocol within 15 days from the time of such request. In the event that You do not wish to make BitKeeper repositories publicly available, You have 15 days in which to negotiate a waiver, convert said repositories to closed use, or cease use of said repositories.

(d) No free use for competitors:  Notwithstanding any other terms in this License, this License is not available to You if You and/or your employer develop, produce, sell, and/or resell a product which contains substantially similar capabilities of the BitKeeper Software, or, in the reasonable opinion of BitMover, competes with the BitKeeper Software.

(e) No combination with competing products:  Inclusion of the BitKeeper Software for use with a system having substantially similar capabilities of the BitKeeper Software requires prior written permission from BitMover.

(f) Staying current:  This license is terminated in the event there is a new release of the BitKeeper Software which has associated regression tests and said regression tests would not be passed by this version of the BitKeeper Software.  This license is terminated in the event there is a new release of the BitKeeper Software which contains any changes to any part of the licensing functions, including but not limited to Open Logging.

(g) No reverse engineering:  You may not yourself and may not permit or enable anyone to:  (i) modify or translate the Software; (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software or otherwise reduce the Software to a form understandable  by humans, except to the extent this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation; or (iii) provide access to the metadata created and managed by BitKeeper to any person or entity which is not licensed to use the BitKeeper Software.

(h) Public reference:  By using the BitKeeper Software, You agree to the public use of your name and/or your companies' name as a user of the BitKeeper Software.

4.  NON-CONFORMING USE

4.1.  Single user packages

For single user BitKeeper Packages, Open Logging is optional.  The total number of allowed single user files is 1000 per licensee.

4.2.  Closed Use

Closed use is the use of the BitKeeper Software without participating in BKL licensing restrictions such as Open Logging.  Closed use of the BitKeeper Software requires that You (or your organization) purchase closed use licenses for all users of the BitKeeper Software within your organization. This license, the BKL, does not convey authority to make closed use of the Bit- Keeper Software.

4.3.  Logging Waivers

Certain sites which do not wish to participate in Open Logging, such as educational or research institutes, may apply for, and may be granted, a written waiver from BitMover, Inc.  After applying for a written waiver, such an institution may use the BitKeeper Software without Open Logging, for up to 90 days, or until a response is received from BitMover, Inc., whichever comes first. Should BitMover not grant your waiver request, You have the option of converting to Open Logging, immediately ter- minating your use of the BitKeeper Software or continuing your use after purchasing closed use license[s].

4.4.  Damages

Use and/or copying of modified versions of the BitKeeper Soft- ware is a violation of copyrights held by BitMover on the Bit- Keeper Software. Use of the BitKeeper Software without a license is a violation of copyrights held by BitMover on the BitKeeper Software. Damages for copyright infringement are the greater of actual damages or statutory damages, which are cur- rently up to $150,000 per infringement.

This license is not available to You if You and/or your company have any unresolved copyright disputes with BitMover.
